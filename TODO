Thorough function test; a high-band rig ought to be enough for most
parts except frequency bits and the rx extender on the low band rigs.

	Update: Extender, frequency testing still remain; the rest is
	mostly done.

Convert a UHF rig, gather a cable and head, and then test UHF.

Find (beg, borrow) an 800 rig, gather a cable and head, and then
test 800.

Build a web interface, so this can be used to provide a public service.
