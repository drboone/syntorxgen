	Automake/autoconf fixes so all the right files get included in the
	distribution tarballs.

	Fix for floating point rounding errors, which led to messages like
	"no valid ref. frequencies for 145.38999123123"

	Added ability to set v-bit splits per-mode

	Allow "mode" without number to automagically assign the next one
	in sequence

	203._5_ is the correct PL; was fixed in code, but not in doco

	Added ability to invert v-bits, useful e.g. for swapping VCOs from
	different range radios

	Band upper limits now have defaults, but can be configured with
	input file statements, to ease hacking radios into different
	bands

1.20rel

	Conversion to GNU build tools

	Port to Solaris.

	Fixed a bug in PL/DPL bit pattern generation -- if 0.0 PL or 0 DPL
	were specified in the input file, the program did not treat them
	the same as not specifying anything.
