HOW TO INSTALL SYNTORXGEN

Syntorxgen comes from http://msuarc.egr.msu.edu/syntorx/.

The syntorxgen program is developed on Linux.  Nearly any modern unix
system should be able to build and run it, if the proper tools are
installed.  It is possible, with some manual intervention, to build
it on a DOS machine using the DJGPP tools.  Windows, Mac and others
have not been tried.

Required tools

	bison
	flex
	make
	an ANSI C compiler

Assuming those tools are installed, building the program should be as
simple as typing "make".  To install the binaries, type "make install".
To install the documentation, type "make install-manpages".
