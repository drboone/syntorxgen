HOW TO INSTALL SYNTORXGEN

The syntorxgen program is developed on Linux.  Nearly any modern unix
system should be able to build and run it, if the proper tools are
installed.  It is possible, with some manual intervention, to build
it on a DOS machine using the DJGPP tools.  Windows, Mac and others
have not been tried.

Required tools

	bison
	flex
	make
	an ANSI C compiler

Assuming those tools are installed, building the program should be as
simple as typing "make".

The supplied Makefile does not provide a means of installing the program.
To install the compiled program, copy the syntorxgen binary to a directory
in your path, e.g. /usr/local/bin.  You may also copy the two man pages
to the appropriate places.  For syntorxgen.1, that would probably be
/usr/local/man/man1.  For syntorxgen.5, it would be /usr/local/man/man5.
