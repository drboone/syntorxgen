.SH NAME
syntorxgen \- Input file format for syntorxgen
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B syntorxgen
input file defines the desired contents of the code plug to be
generated by the program.  The input file is an
.BR ASCII (7)
text file, supplied to the program on its standard input using command
line redirection or pipes.
.LP
Generally speaking, the input is free-form: that is, the program does
not care about indents or line breaks, though white space of some type
is required between tokens.  Obviously some discipline will help
readability...
.LP
Directives in the input file are not case-sensitive.  
.LP
Non-comment lines in the file may only contain sharp characters,
semicolons, curly braces, spaces, tabs, digits and upper or lower
case alphabetics.
.LP
A sharp character (#) anywhere on a line introduces a comment, which
runs to the end of the line on which it appears.  Comments are ignored.
Comments may contain any character.
.SH DEFAULTS
.IP "Reference frequency"
.B syntorxgen
uses the same defaults as Motorola RSS, and will automatically try
to select an alternate if the default is not valid for the desired
transmit frequency.
.IP "Upper limits of radios"
The program assumes some upper frequency limits for each type of radio.
The low band radio is assumed to top out at 100 MHz, the high band
radio at 250 MHz, the UHF radios at 550 MHz, and the 800 radios at
950 MHz.  The UHF range 1 radios are assumed to top out at 435 MHz.
These limits are compiled in, but hopefully allow for most feasible
types of radio modifications.
.IP "V-bit splits"
Most v-bit changeover frequencies are specifiable in the input file.
However, the 800 radio talkaround uses a fixed value of 825 MHz
as the crossover, and this number is compiled into the program.
The default values which are compiled in assume range 2 radios on
high band and UHF.
.IP "Number of modes"
The program pre-sets the number of modes to 32; however this can be
changed by the input file.  The highest number of modes allowed by
the program is 256.  Note that the standard ROM will only hold 128
mode definitions, so hardware changes would be required to actually
achieve 256 mode radios.
.SH "GLOBAL DIRECTIVES"
.LP
Global directives apply to all modes defined by the input file.
.IP "GREFFREQ reference-frequency"
Defines a default reference frequency used for all modes which don't
explicitly define one.  Valid reference frequencies are 4166, 5000
and 6250.
.IP "TXVCOSPLIT vbit-changeover-frequency"
For all radios except the low-band radio, defines the frequency at
which the v-bits must be changed in order for the VCO to continue to
maintain lock on transmit.  Note that this is the
.I transmit
frequency, not the VCO frequency, at which the changeover must occur.
.IP "RXVCOSPLIT vbit-changeover-frequency"
For all radios except the low-band radio, defines the frequency at
which the v-bits must be changed in order for the VCO to continue to
maintain lock on receive.  Note that this is the
.I receive
frequency, not the VCO frequency, at which the changeover must occur.
.IP "LBVCO1SPLITTX vbit-changeover-frequency"
For the low-band radio only, defines the highest transmit
frequency which can be generated using the first VCO subrange.  Note
that this is not the VCO frequency, but the actual operating frequency.
.IP "LBVCO2SPLITTX vbit-changeover-frequency"
For the low-band radio only, defines the highest transmit
frequency which can be generated using the second VCO subrange.  Note
that this is not the VCO frequency, but the actual operating frequency.
.IP "LBVCO3SPLITTX vbit-changeover-frequency"
For the low-band radio only, defines the highest transmit
frequency which can be generated using the third VCO subrange.  Note
that this is not the VCO frequency, but the actual operating frequency.
.IP "LBVCO1SPLITRX vbit-changeover-frequency"
For the low-band radio only, defines the highest receive
frequency which can be generated using the first VCO subrange.  Note
that this is not the VCO frequency, but the actual operating frequency.
.IP "LBVCO2SPLITRX vbit-changeover-frequency"
For the low-band radio only, defines the highest receive
frequency which can be generated using the second VCO subrange.  Note
that this is not the VCO frequency, but the actual operating frequency.
.IP "LBVCO3SPLITRX vbit-changeover-frequency"
For the low-band radio only, defines the highest receive
frequency which can be generated using the third VCO subrange.  Note
that this is not the VCO frequency, but the actual operating frequency.
.IP "MAXLOWBAND highest-lowband-frequency"
Sets the highest frequency which will be considered a low-band
frequency.  The default is 100 MHz.  This should allow for low-band
to mid-band conversions, etc.
.IP "MAXHIGHBAND highest-highband-frequency"
Sets the highest frequency which will be considered a high-band
frequency.  The default is 250 MHz.  This should allow for high-band
to 220 MHz ham band conversions, etc.
.IP "MAXUHFBAND highest-uhf-frequency"
Sets the highest frequency which will be considered a UHF frequency.
The default is 550 MHz, though it isn't clear what use this would
serve.
.IP "MAX800BAND highest-800-frequency"
Sets the highest frequency which will be considered an 800-band
frequency.  The default is 950 MHz.  This should allow for 800-band
to 900-ham band conversions, etc.
.IP "MAXUHFR1BAND highest-uhfrange1-frequency"
Sets the highest frequency which will be considered a range-1 UHF
frequency.  The default is 435 MHz.
.IP "TALKAROUND800 highest-non-ta-800-frequency"
Sets the highest frequency which will be considered a non-talkaround
800-band frequency.  The default is 825 MHz.
.IP "NMODES number-of-modes-in-code-plug"
Defines the number of modes to be emitted in the produced code
plug.  The EEPROM can contain 128, but more than 32 require hardware
modifications to the radio and control head hardware.  Programming more
than 32 modes also affects MPL, and possibly other, options.
.IP "TRVBITINVERT { yes | no }"
If yes, inverts the V0 bit, typically causing the radio to use the
transmit range of the VCO for receive, and vice versa.  The setting
defaults to no.  This directive is primarily for radio hacking, such as
replacing the VCO in a Range 1 UHF radio with one taken from a Range 3
or 4 radio to move it into the ham bands.  The directive does nothing
if the specified frequency is in the low-band range.  On 800 radios,
the bit which needs to be (and is) flipped is the V1 bit.
.SH "PER-MODE DIRECTIVES"
.IP "MODE [mode-number] { mode-definition }"
Announces that directives between { and } apply to the specified
mode.  The mode number may be omitted, in which case the program
will determine which mode number to use by adding one to the most
recently used mode number.  If no modes have been defined, the program
starts with mode 1.  Note that if you skip around in numbering, or
mix specific mode numbers with automatic ones, you can fairly easily
overwrite previously defined modes, and syntorxgen will not stop you.
.IP "LABEL quoted-string"
Defines a label for this mode definition.  The string must be
surrounded by double quote characters (").  Syntorxgen does not use
the label; however input file editing applications might display such
a label to describe the contents of the mode.
.IP "NPSCANLIST mode[, mode]..."
Defines the list of channels scanned during non-priority scan operation.
Default if this directive is not supplied is an empty non-priority scan
list.
.IP "TXDPL dpl-code"
Selects the DPL code to be transmitted by this mode.  Default if this
directive does not appear is to transmit no DPL.  Either normal or
inverted codes may be specified.  See the
.B "DPL codes"
section below for a list of valid DPL codes.
.IP "TXDPLINV { yes | no }"
Defines whether or not the specified transmit DPL code should be
inverted.  Default if this directive does not appear is not to invert.
The program will set the invert bit for an inverted code if the input
file so requests.
.IP "TXPL pl-frequency"
Selects the PL frequency to be transmitted.  Default if this directive
does not appear is to transmit no PL.  See the
.B "PL frequencies"
section below for a list of valid PL frequencies.
.IP "TXMPL { yes | no }"
Enables or disables MPL (operator selectable PL or DPL codes) on
transmit.  Default if this directive does not appear is to disable
transmit MPL.
.IP "RXDPL dpl-code"
Selects the DPL code required to open the receiver squelch in this
mode.  Default if this directive does not appear is to require no DPL.
Either normal or inverted codes may be specified.
.IP "RXDPLINV { yes | no }"
Defines whether or not the specified receive DPL code should be
inverted.  Default if this directive does not appear is not to invert.
The program will set the invert bit for an inverted code if the input
file so requests.
.IP "RXPL pl-frequency"
Selects the PL frequency required to open the receiver squelch in this
mode.  Default if this directive does not appear is to require no PL.
.IP "RXMPL { yes | no }"
Enables or disables MPL (operator selectable PL or DPL codes) on
receive.  Default if this directive does not appear is to disable
MPL on receive.
.IP "TIMEOUT timeout-in-seconds"
Sets the duration of the transmit timeout timer in seconds.  Legal
values range from 15 seconds to 465 seconds (7 minutes, 45 seconds)
in increments of 15 seconds, or 0 for no timeout.  Default if this
directive does not appear is no timeout.
.IP "TXPOWER { high | low }"
For radios with the appropriate hardware (reputedly only some radios
with T53- and T83- ID numbers), selects high or low transmitter output
power.  Default if this option does not appear is high power.
.IP "REFFREQ reference-frequency"
Selects the reference frequency to be used for this mode.  Valid
reference frequencies are 4166, 5000 and 6250.
.IP "SCANTYPE { none | nonpri | sglpri | dblpri }"
Selects the type of scan operation to be conducted when this mode is
active.  Default if this directive does not appear is no scan.
.IP "TBSCAN { yes | no }"
Defines whether or not talkback scan operations should be conducted
when this mode is active.  Default if this directive does not appear
is no talkback scan.
.IP "NPSCANSOURCE { selectable | fixed }"
Specifies whether non-priority scan operations should use the list
of modes defined by the
.B NPSCANLIST
directive, or the modes selected by the operator on a scan control head.
Default if this directive does not appear is the control head.
.IP "SQUELCHTYPE { stdstd | andstd | andor }"
Specifies the 
Default if this directive does not appear is
.B ANDOR
.IP "P1SCANMODE mode-number"
Specifies the number of the mode to be scanned during single-priority
scan operations, or the first-priority channel during double-priority
scan operations, when this mode is selected.  There is no default.
.IP "P2SCANMODE mode-number"
Specifies the second-priority channel during double-priority scan
operations when this mode is selected.  There is no default.
.IP "TXFREQ transmit-frequency"
Specifies the transmit frequency for this mode in megahertz, e.g.:
.I 154.100
There is no default.
.IP "RXFREQ receive-frequency"
Specifies the receive frequency for this mode in megahertz.
There is no default.
.IP "RXEXTENDER { yes | no }"
Enables or disables the receiver extender (a.k.a. noise blanker) in
low-band radios.  Default is to disable the extender.
.IP "PMTXVCOSPLIT vbit-changeover-frequency"
Equivalent to TXVCOSPLIT, except it only affects the functioning of
the mode definition in which it appears.  Primarily useful for radio
testing and debugging.
.IP "PMRXVCOSPLIT vbit-changeover-frequency"
Equivalent to RXVCOSPLIT, except it only affects the functioning of
the mode definition in which it appears.  Primarily useful for radio
testing and debugging.

.LP
The program will actually generate bit patterns for any DPL value.
However, at least some radios (notably the Yaesu VX-5R handheld)
are particular about a few bits which the available documentation
states should be all-ones.  These bits are generally set to all ones
by aftermarket software, but Motorola sets them to other values.
For standard DPL codes, the correct values of these bits have
been determined by exhaustive test and are contained in a table in
the program.  For others, you're on your own, but the author would
appreciate any information you have on the subject or any patterns
you determine empirically.
