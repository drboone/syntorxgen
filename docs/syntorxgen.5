.SH NAME
syntorxgen \- Input file format for syntorxgen
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B syntorxgen
input file defines the desired contents of the code plug to be
generated by the program.  The input file is an
.BR ASCII (7)
text file, supplied to the program on its standard input using
command line redirection or pipes.  Directives in the input file
are not case-sensitive.
.SH DEFAULTS
.IP "Reference frequency"
.B syntorxgen
uses the same defaults as Motorola RSS, and will automatically try
to select an alternate if the default is not valid for the desired
transmit frequency.
.SH "GLOBAL DIRECTIVES"
.LP
Global directives apply to all modes defined by the input file.
.IP "GREFFREQ reference-frequency"
Defines a default reference frequency used for all modes which don't
explicitly define one.  Valid reference frequencies are 4166, 5000
and 6250.
.IP "TXVCOSPLIT vbit-changeover-frequency"
For all radios except the low-band radio, defines the frequency at
which the v-bits must be changed in order for the VCO to continue to
maintain lock on transmit.  Note that this is the
.I transmit
frequency, not the VCO frequency, at which the changeover must occur.
.IP "RXVCOSPLIT vbit-changeover-frequency"
For all radios except the low-band radio, defines the frequency at
which the v-bits must be changed in order for the VCO to continue to
maintain lock on receive.  Note that this is the
.I receive
frequency, not the VCO frequency, at which the changeover must occur.
.IP "NMODES number-of-modes-in-code-plug"
Defines the number of modes to be emitted in the produced code
plug.  The EEPROM can contain 128, but more than 32 require hardware
modifications to the radio and control head hardware.  Programming more
than 32 modes also affects MPL, and possibly other, options.
.IP "MODE mode-number { mode-definition }"
Announces that directives between { and } apply to the specified mode.
.SH "PER-MODE DIRECTIVES"
.IP "NPSCANLIST mode[, mode]..."
Defines the list of channels scanned during non-priority scan operation.
Default if this directive is not supplied is an empty non-priority scan
list.
.IP "TXDPL dpl-code"
Selects the DPL code to be transmitted by this mode.  Default if this
directive does not appear is to transmit no DPL.  Either normal or
inverted codes may be specified.  See the
.B "DPL codes"
section below for a list of valid DPL codes.
.IP "TXDPLINV { yes | no }"
Defines whether or not the specified transmit DPL code should be
inverted.  Default if this directive does not appear is not to invert.
The program will set the invert bit for an inverted code if the input
file so requests.
.IP "TXPL pl-frequency"
Selects the PL frequency to be transmitted.  Default if this directive
does not appear is to transmit no PL.  See the
.B "PL frequencies"
section below for a list of valid PL frequencies.
.IP "TXMPL { yes | no }"
Enables or disables MPL (operator selectable PL or DPL codes) on
transmit.  Default if this directive does not appear is to disable
transmit MPL.
.IP "RXDPL dpl-code"
Selects the DPL code required to open the receiver squelch in this
mode.  Default if this directive does not appear is to require no DPL.
Either normal or inverted codes may be specified.
.IP "RXDPLINV { yes | no }"
Defines whether or not the specified receive DPL code should be
inverted.  Default if this directive does not appear is not to invert.
The program will set the invert bit for an inverted code if the input
file so requests.
.IP "RXPL pl-frequency"
Selects the PL frequency required to open the receiver squelch in this
mode.  Default if this directive does not appear is to require no PL.
.IP "RXMPL { yes | no }"
Enables or disables MPL (operator selectable PL or DPL codes) on
receive.  Default if this directive does not appear is to disable
MPL on receive.
.IP "TIMEOUT timeout-in-seconds"
Sets the duration of the transmit timeout timer in seconds.  Legal
values range from 15 seconds to 465 seconds (7 minutes, 45 seconds)
in increments of 15 seconds, or 0 for no timeout.  Default if this
directive does not appear is no timeout.
.IP "TXPOWER { high | low }"
For radios with the appropriate hardware (reputedly only some radios
with T53- and T83- ID numbers), selects high or low transmitter output
power.  Default if this option does not appear is high power.
.IP "REFFREQ reference-frequency"
Selects the reference frequency to be used for this mode.  Valid
reference frequencies are 4166, 5000 and 6250.
.IP "SCANTYPE { none | nonpri | sglpri | dblpri }"
Selects the type of scan operation to be conducted when this mode is
active.  Default if this directive does not appear is no scan.
.IP "TBSCAN { yes | no }"
Defines whether or not talkback scan operations should be conducted
when this mode is active.  Default if this directive does not appear
is no talkback scan.
.IP "NPSCANSOURCE { selectable | fixed }"
Specifies whether non-priority scan operations should use the list
of modes defined by the
.B NPSCANLIST
directive, or the modes selected by the operator on a scan control head.
Default if this directive does not appear is the control head.
.IP "SQUELCHTYPE { stdstd | andstd | andor }"
Specifies the 
Default if this directive does not appear is
.B ANDOR
.IP "P1SCANMODE mode-number"
Specifies the number of the mode to be scanned during single-priority
scan operations, or the first-priority channel during double-priority
scan operations, when this mode is selected.  There is no default.
.IP "P2SCANMODE mode-number"
Specifies the second-priority channel during double-priority scan
operations when this mode is selected.  There is no default.
.IP "TXFREQ transmit-frequency"
Specifies the transmit frequency for this mode in megahertz, e.g.:
.I 154.100
.IP "RXFREQ receive-frequency"
Specifies the receive frequency for this mode in megahertz.
