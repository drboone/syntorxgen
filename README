HOW TO INSTALL SYNTORXGEN

Syntorxgen comes from http://msuarc.egr.msu.edu/syntorx/.

The syntorxgen program is developed on Linux.  Nearly any modern
unix system should be able to build and run it, if the proper tools
are installed.  It has also been built on MS-DOS using djgpp and on
Windows using Cygwin.

Required tools

	autoconf
	automake
	bison
	flex
	make
	an ANSI C compiler

Assuming those tools are installed, building the program should be as
simple as typing:

	./bootstrap
	./configure
	make
	make install

On FreeBSD, you may want the gnu-<tool> variants of the autotools
listed above, and if you intend to use those, you will have to put
/usr/local/gnu-autotools/bin in your path.
