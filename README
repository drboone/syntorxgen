HOW TO INSTALL SYNTORXGEN

Syntorxgen comes from http://www.kb8zqz.org/syntorx/.

The syntorxgen program is developed on Linux.  Nearly any modern
unix system should be able to build and run it, if the proper tools
are installed.  It has also been built on MS-DOS using djgpp and on
Windows using Cygwin.

Required tools

	autoconf
	automake
	bison
	flex
	make
	an ANSI C compiler

Assuming those tools are installed, building the program should be as
simple as typing:

	./bootstrap
	./configure
	make
	make install

On FreeBSD, you will want the gnu-<tool> variants of the autotools.
To use them, you will have to put /usr/local/gnu-autotools/bin in your
path.  Installation is probably most easily achieved using sysinstall.

On NetBSD, you will need to build Bison and Automake from the pkgsrc
system.  These two will bring a few other dependencies along with
them, e.g. m4, autoconf.  For more information on pkgsrc, see:
